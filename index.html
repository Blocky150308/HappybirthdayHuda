      <div class="highlight" style="font-size:10px">
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align:center;">A poem for my favourite girl ‚ô°</p>
        You came like rain to a waiting land, <br>
        soft in your step, yet steady in hand.<br>
        Pink hue gathers wherever you go,<br>
        bubblegum warmth in a gentle glow.<br>
        I love the small things only you keep:<br>
        scrunchies and poems, treasures that sleep.<br>
        <br>
        Since the first of March your laughter has grown,<br>
        a map in my heart I‚Äôve made my own.<br>
        We built little forts from ordinary days,<br>
        snacks tucked in drawers, love stitched in ways.<br>
        Your words are beads on a shining thread,<br>
        I carry them all, the things you said.<br>
        <br>
        When rain taps the glass, I imagine your eyes,<br>
        the calm in your voice, the way silence replies.<br>
        For you it is promise, for me it is peace,<br>
        a ritual we guard so it will not cease.<br>
        Hydrangeas, tulips, and roses I‚Äôll bring,<br>
        chosen with care for the breath you sing.<br>
        <br>
        I know the storms that trouble your air,<br>
        the battles with dust, the weight you bear.<br>
        I‚Äôll sweep the corners, I‚Äôll guard the night,<br>
        I‚Äôll carry the burden until it feels light.<br>
        To love is to guard the breath you take,<br>
        to stand through the storms that try to break.<br>
        <br>
        Your birthday shines like a coin I save,<br>
        a secret fire, a wish I crave.<br>
        I‚Äôll paint the day soft in colors you love,<br>
        pinks like sunsets and skies above.<br>
        No grand legends, no empty show,<br>
        just truth of us in the way we grow.<br>
        <br>
        So stay with your poems, your tender art,<br>
        scrunchies like crowns and your endless heart.<br>
        Believe in dinosaurs, rain, and dreams,<br>
        trust in pinky-promise schemes.<br>
        Huda, my wonder, my sweetest song,<br>
        with you is the place I‚Äôve belonged all along.<br>
        <br>
        You‚Äôre the chain around my chest,<br>
        tight enough to hurt, but without it<br>
        my heart would scatter like startled birds.<br>
        I breathe because you don‚Äôt let me unravel.<br>
        <br>
        Without you, I‚Äôm a carcass picked clean,<br>
        a body walking with nothing inside.<br>
        You don‚Äôt give me life,<br>
        you remind me what it costs to keep it.<br>
        <br>
        When your arms lock around me,<br>
        it isn‚Äôt captivity, it‚Äôs comfort,<br>
        and I beg for it,<br>
        because freedom tastes like silence and knives.<br>
        <br>
        If you vanished, I‚Äôd rot loud,<br>
        a ruin screaming your name into every wall,<br>
        because even my echo would know:<br>
        you were the pulse, I was just the vessel.<br>
